# Overview


Keynote makes it easy to create and show  beautiful  presentations. Start with  one of the themes, then modify it however you like . Each theme comes with predesigned styles- coordinated sets of colors, borders, effects, and so on- for text , shapes, photos, video , and other objects.

when you select text or an object - like a photo or a shape -  in a presentation, formattting controls for it appear in the sidebar on the right. Only the controls you need to modify object are visible. If you don't see a sidebar, click in the toolbar

You can quickly change the look of the selected text or object(image,shape, table,  or cell) by applying a new style to it . For  text, click the paragraph style name at the top of the sidebar on the right and choose a new paragraph style. For objects, click one  of the six object styles.

Use the other controls in the sidebar to customize the object however you like. You can save your setting as a new style , which is the available in the sidebar so you can apply it to other next text or object. You can also save the presentation as a new theme.
