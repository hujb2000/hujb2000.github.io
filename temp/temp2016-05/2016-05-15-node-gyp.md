# node-gyp

[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

Node.js native addon build tool

`node-gyp` is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native add on modules for Node.js. it bundles the [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp) project used by the Chromium team and takes away the  pain of dealing with the  various differences in build platforms. It is the replacement  to the node-waf program which is removed for node v0.8. If you have a native addon for node that still has a wscript file , the you should definitely add a binding.gyp file to support the latest version of node.
