# MicroService

## Node.js

### Senecajs.org

[Seneca](http://senecajs.org)

Seneca is a microservices toolkit for Node.js.
It helps you write clean, organized code that you can scale and deploy at any time.

You write everything as a command . Your commands get called whenever they  match a set of properties. Your calling code doesn't know, or care, which command gets the work done. One JavaScript object goes in, and another comes out, asynchronously.
